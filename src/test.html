            <strong>This Firmware is a complete new Implementation of the <a href="https://rcoid.de/">Rcoid</a> Project.</strong>
            <p>
                This implementation supports the same Interface for the RcOid App. Has a extended Web UI and REST-Api. Devices can be used as IR-Gateway trought MQTT.
                Sending and reciving IR-Codes new implemented for blocking free work. Also the storage of IR-Codes (Commands) added. This Commands can be used for MQTT and REST.
                Upload and Downlowad of stored commands are possible. 
            </p>
            <a>
                A new unconfigured Device will start in Accesspoint-Mode and provide a 'ESP8266 for RCoid Access Point' with User pass and Password pass.
                You are able to setup SSID and Password for your local WiFi-Connection. </br>
                From the Root-Page you have also the possibility tor reboot, remove Web Config, and reset to Factory.
                Only from this page you can enable IR-reciving to capture IR-Codes. </br>
                From the MQTT Page you can ste the Connection to your MQTT-Server and a Prefix used for the topic on MQTT. If the MQTT-Server adress empty or a '.' the MQTT communication will be disabled.
            </a>
            <a>
                In MQTT the device will be provide its local IP-Adress and available commands. The device subscribes /[Prefix]/Cmd. If the device receive a String in this topic, this will be interpreted as a Command. 
                The device try to find this Command and will send the Code from immedaly.
            </a>
            <a>
                The same Functionality can be reached by sending a GET-Request to /cmd?button=xxxx. Where xxxx the name of the command. It can be taken from the Command-Page.
                The Command page are selfexplanating. But one Point you have to know. if You edit a Command you have to set a Code and a Name. The Name will be used as Filnename to stor the command on device Flash.
                The Clock Icon on the Command-Page will give you the possibilty to setup one Timer to send this command later.
